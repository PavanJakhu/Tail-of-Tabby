Tail of Tabby
=============
A top-down RPG where the Tabby, the cat, fights off tens of enemies in order to defeat the Hound Empire.

The porject is unfinshed due to the battle screen not working.

I did the overworld and menus of the game while my two partners Adam Gadal and James Nguyem did the battle screen and art, respectively.
