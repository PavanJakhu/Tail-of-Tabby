Tail of Tabby
=============
A, Actionscript 3 in Flash, top-down RPG where the Tabby, the cat, fights off tens of enemies in order to defeat the Hound Empire.

STATUS: Incomplete, on permanent hiatus.

I did the overworld and menus of the game while my two partners Adam Gadal and James Nguyem did the battle screen and art, respectively.

The title iamge is from: http://bit.ly/1rHpkpE.
The music is from: http://blog.dayjo.org/free-rpg-music-pack-part-1/.
The rest of the iamges are either drawn from our artist (James Nguyen) or found on google.
